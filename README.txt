Email: exampleexaminer@gmail.com
Username: 31cskad4iqej67l4vdl3oeipfh5i

If this account is not used then the program will not be able to run, even if logged in with a personal Spotify account.
If logging in requires e-mail verification, use the same details above on Gmail.

When running for the first time, or if the config file does not exist / cannot be found make sure you:

- Log into Spotify when the window opens.
- Authorise the program to access data.
- Copy the URL of the example domain tab.
- Paste the FULL URL after the program prompt.

There may be slight issues with modules between each OS. This was made and bug tested using both MacOS and Windows.
